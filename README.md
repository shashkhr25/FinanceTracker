# Personal Finance Tracker

## Overview

Personal Finance Tracker is a user-friendly tool designed to help users effortlessly manage their personal finances. This application provides comprehensive tracking of net worth, savings, and debt, while ensuring that expenses made via credit cards are not tracked multiple times.
Problem Statement

This leads to confusion and inaccuracies in financial reporting. Our tool addresses this issue, ensuring that users have a clear and precise view of their financial situation.
